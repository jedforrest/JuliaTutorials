# Julia Tutorials
Interactive tutorials for using Julia and various packages.

Julia is a general-purpose programming language that includes many powerful mathematical modelling packages.

These tutorials use Jupyter notebooks which include interactive snippets of code and output.

Note that Julia can also be scripted and run directly from the the terminal.

You will need to install the following to get started:

**todo write as steps**
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/install/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or any program which can run Jupyter Notebooks)

Optional:
- [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) for managing multiple Julia versions and updates
- Tutorial from the Catalyst.jl docs for [new julia users](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/introduction_to_catalyst/catalyst_for_new_julia_users/)
and for those with [some julia experience](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/introduction_to_catalyst/introduction_to_catalyst/#introduction_to_catalyst).
